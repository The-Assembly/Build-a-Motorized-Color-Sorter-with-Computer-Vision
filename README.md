# Build-a-Motorized-Color-Sorter-with-Computer-Vision

## Getting Started
Objective of this workshop is to introduce Computer Vision using Raspberry Pi to the community in a fun and interactive way.
The colored objects will be processed by the webcam and it will be sorted into their respective stacks based on the color identified by the webcam.

## Prerequisites
- A Laptop
- Basic Python programing skills

### Components Needed
- Raspberry Pi 3 (1)
- Webcam (1)
- Servo Motors (2)
- LM7805 voltage regulator(1)
- Male to Male Jumper wires and Male to Female Jumper Wires
- Breadboard (1)
- 9v Battery and Power Bank (1 of each)
- Colored cubes (or objects - Red,Blue,Yellow)

### Software/Libraries Needed
- Python 2.7
